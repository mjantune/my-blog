# Example: tSNE on MNIST

# Practical Notes
-Results heavily depend on hyperparameters (perplexity)
    - A good practice it to use several projections with different perplexities (5-100)
- Due to stochastic nature, tSNE provides different projections even for the same data/hyperparameter
    - Train and test should be projected together
- tSNE runs for a long time with a big number of features (>500)
    - It is common to do dimensionality reduction before projection (to reduce to 100 for example)
- Implementation of tSNE can be found in sklearn library.
    - The standalone implementation python package tSNE is faster.

# Conclusion
- tSNE is a great tool for visualization
- It can be used as a feature as well
- Be careful wth interpretation of results
- Try different perplexities
