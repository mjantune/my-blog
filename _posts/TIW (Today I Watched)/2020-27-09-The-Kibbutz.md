The Kibbutz are a tipe of Commune that exists in Israel since around 1910. These were created to be a type of socialist utopia, where all me members would share everything, and everyone would earn the same. The was no private property, and there was supposed to be gender equality. However this Kibbutz had a crisis in the 1980's after which they were reformed, eventually allowing private property, but keepig a strong Safety Net.

From the [Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs][1]:
> The kibbutz is a self-contained social and economic unit in which decisions are taken by its members, and property and means of production are communally owned. Today 1.7 percent of the population lives in 267 kibbutzim. Members are assigned work in different branches of the kibbutz economy: traditionally the backbone of Israel's agriculture, kibbutzim are now increasingly engaged in industry, tourism, and services. Many kibbutzim have modified their traditional collective approach and are in various stages of privatization.

## Key Features

- They must be small communities (Up to 150 families, but normally around 150 persons).
- Being small allows them to socially police the freerider problem.
- Leadership rotates, and should be awarded to the members that do more than their fair share of the work.
- Some of the crisis were created when the generations changed, because what had been a choice for some in the beginning became the default.
- At some points the kids were raised away from their families, in children homes. Only being with their parents for 2 hours a day. This helped the women avoid the burden of childcare, helping gender equality, however this way of living was later rejected.
- Strong emphasis of agriculture. The kibbutz produce 40% the agricultural output, and 9% of Israel's industrial output, despite being 1.7 percent of the [population][2].

## [Jim Rutt Show][3]

> Ran Abramitzky talks to Jim about his book, The Mystery of the Kibbutz: history of the kibbutz movement, social and economic impact in Israel, group governance, family life, the role of coherence & homogeneity, economic forces vs egalitarianism, kibbutz life as social insurance, educational dynamics, changing governmental relationships after 1977, and the wider variety of contemporary kibbutzim. They finish the conversation by exploring other egalitarian living projects and what can be learned from the kibbutz movement: the costs & benefits of equality, the importance of ideological coherence, religious vs secular community challenges, and much more.
