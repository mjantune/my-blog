Graded Advanced Features II Quiz

1. Question 1: Imagine that we apply X = PCA(n_components=5).fit_transform(data) and data has shape (5000, 53). What is the shape of X? 1 point
- (5, 53)
- (5000, 5)
- X (5, 5000)
- (53, 5)

2. Question 2: To which data NMF is NOT applicable? 1 point

- Bag-of-words matrix
- X Standartized matrix
- One-Hot encoded feature

3. Question 3: Suppose we have 2 categorical features: f1 with A possible values and f2 with B possible values. How many values will their interaction have? 1 point

- Exactly A + B
- Exactly A * B
- X Less or equal to A * B
- max(A, B)

4. Question 4: Imagine we have 2 categorical features represented as integers: f1 with all values in range [0, 1000] and f2 with values in range [0, 100]. What is the correct way to build their interaction? 1 point

- f1 + f2
- f1.astype(str) + f2.astype(str)
- X f1.astype(str) + "_" + f2.astype(str)
- (f1 + f2).astype(str)

5. Question 5: What is a correct way to get t-SNE projection of train and test data? 1 point

- Apply t-SNE to the train and after that to the test.
- Apply t-SNE to the test first and after to train.
- X Apply t-SNE to concatenation of train and test and split projection back.
- Doesn't matter, all variants will produce the same result.  

6. Question 6: Is it possible to do t-SNE projection into 20-dimensional space? 1 point

- X Yes, why not.
- No, only 2-dim or 3-dim projections are possible.
