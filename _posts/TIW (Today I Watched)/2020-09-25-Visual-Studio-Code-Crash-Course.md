## Emmet

Emmet: Abreviations for working faster with html and CSS.
Automatically creates snippets of code.

## Themes and Extension

You can change the theme of VS Code, for example to Cobalt2.

Examples:

- Prettier Code Formatter
- Advanced New File
- Better Comments
- Quokka (for Javascript)
- Live Server
- Auto Rename Tag
- Bracket Colorizer
- Markdown PDF

You can change Keyboard Shortcuts, just search for "Keyboard SHortcuts in the Command Palette"

For example, I changed Ctrl+N to use:
Ctrl+N          -> Advanced New File

## Version Control

Very good way of seeing changes in files (diff command).
It's possible to create a new repository in Github directly from VS Code, without having to create it first in Github.com.
There is a very good extension called Git Lens
Live Share Extension: You can share code live with someone else, to do a collaboration sesion.
